# visit planner

This is an OSS project to facilitate process of plannig visits to school for the students, their parents and teachers.
At this moment before you meet the teacher at the school you have to:
1. Visit the school and use one of notebooks, placed on the secretary's table (one for each teacher), to write down the name of the student in the table, previously drawn by the teacher providing consultations. 
2. Or you can call the school and ask the secretary to do for you the work described above.
There are a lot of issues arising with such an appointment making process:
* it's not automated, offline and requres anybody (you or the school secretary) to be phisically present at the school;
* teachers' schedules are not fixed and time to time they need to be manually arranged, so often in the teacher's notebook you can find no tables for the dates you are interested in, or there are no vacant places in the tables present; this way you can't plan anything at all, waiting while the teacher finishes planning their meetings for the next period of time;
* sometimes you (or your student children) have to waste your time making extra visits just because you were unable to fix your visits to the teachers, who are present at the school at the same time;
* the same story happens when the students write their tests: their places have to be reserved beforehand, so the teachers could prepare test materials; sometimes teachers mistakenly print out wrong papers and students get troubles passing their tests; 
* there is no other way to get to know your tests result except you personally meet your teacher - additional visits required;
* and so on.
